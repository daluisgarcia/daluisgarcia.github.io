# Personal Portfolio Website

This is a personal portfolio website built using Vue 3 and Vite. The website is a single page application that showcases my projects, skills, and contact information. The website is responsive and works on all devices. The projects and technologies data come from an API that I built using Django and Django Rest Framework. The repository for the API can be found [here](https://github.com/daluisgarcia/projects-portfolio-api)

## Project setup

### Dependencies installation

``` bash
# yarn
yarn

# npm
npm install

```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

``` bash
# yarn
yarn dev

# npm
npm run dev

```

### Compiles and minifies for production

This command will update the `docs` folder with the production build. This is done so that the website can be hosted on GitHub Pages.

``` bash
# yarn
yarn build

# npm
npm run build

```

### Customize Vite configuration

See [Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).
